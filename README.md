# Zsh tips, tricks and features

Here are some tips, tricks and features of the Z Shell. Most of the tips are
taken from the internet, either from [the official zsh website][zsh] or from other
places online. If you find anything that could be considered personal property
and would like it taken down, send an email at <alexghergh@gmail.com>.

### 1. Passing options to the `zsh` command

Options can be passed to the zsh command in different forms, either as short
options or as long GNU-style options. The special options `--version` and
`--help` are handled separately. For the other options, they can be specified by
name using the `-o` flag, followed by the option name, to turn the option _on_.
To turn it _off_, the option should be preceded by `+o` instead:

`zsh -o shwordsplit` (turn `shwordsplit` on)

or

`zsh +o shwordsplit` (turn `shwordsplit` off)

The long option style is `--option-name`. To turn it off, the same as above can
be applied, i.e. substitute the first `-` for a `+` (`+-option-name`), which is
equivalent to `--no-option-name`.

Passing `--help` to the command lists a set of options that can be turned on or
off.

### 2. Interactive and login shells

Depending on how a particular shell instance is started, the shell can be
interactive or non-interactive, login or non-login. When you manually type
commands in front of a shell, it is interactive. When you run a script in a
shell, it happens to be non-interactive (though careful, the first shell that
launches the command - say `zsh script` - is interactive, and it hangs around
while the second shell, which runs the script and is non-interactive, finishes).

When a system boots up, and after you type the password, the program
`/bin/login` reads the file `/etc/passwd` and automatically launches a **login**
shell. Other shells launched from this shell are all non-login shells. To tell
the difference, the `/bin/login` program usually sticks a `-` in front of the
login shell. You can get the name of the shell currently active by `echo $0`. If
it contains the `-` at the beginning, it is a login shell.

**Note**: There may possibly be non-interactive login shells, when for example
windowing systems might lunch some startup scripts, and then launch the real
interactive login shell.

**Note 2**: Programs like `tmux` launch by default login shells. This happens
because, for example, you might have a tmux session running, and then logout
(which means `.zlogout` is ran), but the tmux server is still running in the
background. If the shells would then not be login shells, they might not
properly run after logging in again. This means shells running inside `tmux` are
interactive login shells.

To test if a shell is interactive/login:

```zsh
# To check if a shell is a login shell
if [[ -o login ]]; then
    print "Login"
else
    print "Non-login"
fi

# To check if a shell is an interactive shell
if [[ -o interactive ]]; then
    print "Interactive"
else
    print "Non-interactive"
fi
```

### 3. Startup/Shutdown Files

The order the files are read by `zsh` is:

- `/etc/zshenv`: this is the first file read, and this cannot be changed.
Subsequent files are read according to the variables `RCS` and `GLOBAL_RCS` (if
`RCS` is unset in any of the files, no other files will be read after it; if
`GLOBAL_RCS` is unset in any of the files, no other global files - `/etc/<file>`
\- will be read after it).
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`: if `$ZDOTDIR` is unset, `$HOME` is used instead.
- `/etc/zprofile`, then `$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile` (if the shell is a login shell)
- `/etc/zshrc`, then `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` (if the shell is an interactive shell)
- `/etc/zlogin`, then `$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin` (if the shell is a login shell)
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout`, then `/etc/zlogout` (when a login shell exits)

However, if the shell terminates by `exec`'ing another process, the logout files
are not used.

**Note**: Some of the files may be located in `/etc/zsh/..` rater than just
`/etc/..`.

**Note 2**: `PATH` shouldn't be modified in any `zshenv` file in Arch Linux, as
the `/etc/zprofile` file builds it from scratch.

Generally, users should only touch the `$ZDOTDIR/<file>` files, while the
`/etc/<file>` files should only be managed by administrators.

More on what the files should contain:
- `zshenv`: sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the `-f` option is
  set. Should contain commands to set the search path and other imporant
  environment variables. _It should not contain commands that produce output_.
- `zshrc`: sourced in interactive shells. Should contain commands to set up
  aliases, functions, options, keybindings, etc.
- `zlogin`: sourced in login shells. Should contain commands that should only be
  executed in login shells (TODO example?).
- `zprofile`: similar to `zlogin`, except is is sourced before `zshrc`. This
  file is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin` for ksh fans. The two are not
  intended to be used together, though this can be done. `zlogin` should not
  define aliases, commands, options, environment variables etc. It should rather
  be used to set the terminal type and run a series of commands (`fortune`,
  `msgs` etc.). `zprofile` should be used for things that are inherited by
  non-`zsh` processes (like `PATH` of program-specific environment variables).

### 4. Precommand modifiers

Simple commands may be preceded by _precommand modifiers_, which alter how the
command is interpreted. These are shell builtins, except for `nocorrect` which
is a reserved word.

- `-`: The command is executed with a `-` prepended to its `argv[0]` string
  (e.g. `- echo hello`).
- `builtin`: The command word is taken to be a builtin command rather than a
  shell function or an external command.
- `command` [`-pvV`]: The command word is taken to be an external command,
  rather than a shell function or a builtin. The `-p` flag causes a default path
  to be searched, instead of that in `$PATH`. The `-v` flag causes a command to
  be displayed as how it would be run (synonym to `whence`). The `-V` switch
  displays a more verbose output (synonym to `whence -v`).
- `exec`: Run the command in place of the current shell, instead of as a
  subprocess. The shell does not fork, but is completely replaced. It does not
  invoke a `TRAPEXIT`, nor does it invoke `zlogout` files.
- `nocorrect`: No spelling correction is done on any words.
- `noglob`: No filename generation/globbing is performed.
